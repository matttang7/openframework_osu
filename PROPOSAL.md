# Project Proposal
The project I want to make is a rhythm game called osu. In this game, circles, sliders, and spinners appear and the player must click to them based on the timing of the song. The slider is where the player drags from one circle in a path to the other and for the spinner it counts the revolutions. 
The libraries I plan to use for this project are graphic, sound, and json. Graphics will be used for drawing the shapes and the background of the game. Sound will be used to play the music and get timing parts from the song. Json will be used for storing the maps of each song, with circles, sliders, and spinners. 
If I have time, I will make a map creation tool, where the user could create their map by clicking and getting coordinates/times.
